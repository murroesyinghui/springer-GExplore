\section{Definition}

Exploratory methods have been originally introduced as a mean to extract knowledge from relational data without knowing what to search~\cite{idreos2015overview}. 
Recently, \emph{graph exploration} has been introduced to perform exploratory analyses on graph-shaped data~\cite{mottin2017graph}. 
Graph exploration aims at mitigating the access to the data to the user, even if such user is a novice. 

Algorithms for graph exploration assume the user is not able to completely specify the object of interest with  a structured query, like a SPARQL~\cite{prud2006sparql} query, but rather expresses the need with a simpler, more ambiguous language.

This asymmetry between the rigidity of structured queries and ambiguity of the user has inspired the study of approximate, flexible, and example-based methods. 


%Main Text
%%% Explain the main techniques
\section{Overview}

The research on graph exploration has revolved around three main pillars: \emph{keyword graph queries}, \emph{exploratory graph analysis}, and \emph{refinement of query results} 

% We abstracted user-driven graph exploration properties from techniques proposed in the literature and defined such a unified taxonomy. 


\stitle{Keyword Graph Queries} \dnote{(Yinghui)} 

\stitle{Exploratory Graph Analysis} entails the process of casting an incomplete or imperfect pattern query to let the system find the closest match. Such exploratory analysis may return a huge number of results, e.g., structures matching the pattern. Thus, the system is required to provide intelligent support. One such strategy is the well known query-by-example paradigm, in which the user provides the template for the tuples and let the system infer the others. 

\stitle{Refinement of Graph Query Results} is needed to deal with the overwhelming amount of results that is typical in subgraph processing. It includes approaches designed to present comprehensive result sets to the user or intermediate results that can be refined further. 
%Instantiations of this kind are graph summaries, top-k methods, query reformulation, and skyline queries. 
	% \item [Focused Graph Mining] guides the users to a specific portion of the graph they are interested in. It requires the user to provide feedback in the process to restrict the computation to some portion of the graph. Ego-networks mining belongs to this strategy, since the user search is limited to a particular area of the graph and the algorithms focus on that specific area. 


\section{Key Research Findings}

\subsection{Graph Search with Keywords (Yinghui)} 

Keyword search (\kws) has been routinely used to 
explore and understand graph data~\citep{wang2010survey,bao2015exploratory,yahya2016exploratory,mottin2017graph}. 
(1) A keyword query $Q$ is a set of terms $\{t_1, ..., t_n\}$. 
Given graph $G$=$(V, E)$ and a term $t_i$, a match function 
determines a set of {\em content nodes} $V(t_i)\subseteq V$ that match $t_i$. 
(2) An answer 
$G_Q$ of a keyword query $Q$ is a subgraph of $G$ that contains at least 
one node from $V(t_i)$ for each $t_i\in Q$. 
In keyword-based graph exploration, 
a function $F(G_Q)$ is used to quantify the 
cost of connecting all content nodes in $G$. 
Answers with smaller cost have higher quality. 

Given a node pair $(u, v)$ 
in graph $G$, (1) the distance from $u$ to $v$,
denoted as $\dist(u,v)$, is the sum of edge weight 
on the shortest path from $u$ to $v$; and  
(2) $\len(u,v)$ denotes the length of 
the shortest path from $u$ to $v$. 
There are three common classes of \kws queries. 

\vspace{.5ex}
\etitle{Distinct root-based KWS}~\citep{kacholia2005bidirectional,he2007blinks}. 
These query defines $G_Q$ as a minimal rooted tree 
which (1) contains a distinct root node $v_r$, and 
at least a content node $v_i\in V(t_i)$ as a leaf for each $t_i\in Q$; 
and (2) $\len(v_r, v_i)\leq r$ for a predefined hop bound $r$, 
for each leaf $v_i$.  Here, $G_Q$ is minimal if 
no subtree of $G_Q$ is an answer of $Q$ in $G$. 
The function $F(G_Q)$ is defined as 
$F(G_Q) = \sum_{t_i\in Q}\dist(v_r, v_i)$, 
where $v_i$ ranges over the content nodes. 

The answers of such queries can be found in  
$O(|Q|(|V|\log|V|+|E|))$ time (cf.~\citep{yu2010keyword}). 

\etitle{Steiner tree-based KWS}~\citep{bhalotia2002keyword}. 
A Steiner tree-based query differs 
from its distinct root-based counterparts 
in that it uses a different cost function $F(G_Q)$, which is defined as 
$\sum_{e\in G_Q} w(e)$, 
\ie the total weight of the edges in the Steiner tree $G_Q$. 

%%%%%%%%%
It is \NP-hard~\citep{yu2010keyword} to evaluate a Steiner tree-based query  
by computing a minimum weighted Steiner tree (\MST, a known \NP-hard problem~\citep{ding2007finding}). 
Both exact~\citep{ding2007finding} and 
approximation algorithms~\citep{byrka2013steiner} 
have been developed to evaluate such queries. 

\vspace{.5ex}
\etitle{Steiner graph-based KWS}~\citep{li2008ease,kargar2011keyword}. 
Finding $G_Q$ as graphs rather than trees may be more helpful. For Steiner graph-based queries with a number $r$,  
$G_Q$ is a Steiner graph that contains content and Steiner nodes (\ie nodes 
on shortest paths between two content nodes), with either radius bounded by $r$ 
(\ie r-radius Steiner graph~\citep{li2008ease}), or distance between 
any two content nodes bounded by $r$ (\ie $r$-clique~\citep{kargar2011keyword}). 
For an answer $G_Q$ with nodes $\{v_1, \ldots, v_n\}$,  its cost $F(G_Q)$ 
is computed as  
$\sum_{i\in[1, n]}\sum_{j\in[i+1,n]}\dist(v_i, v_j)$, 
\ie the total pairwise distances of the 
content nodes in $G_Q$. 
Here, the distances are typically 
induced by undirected shortest paths.  

It is in general \NP-hard 
to evaluate Steiner graph-based queries~\citep{yu2010keyword, kargar2011keyword}. 
Approximate algorithms are developed for such queries to 
find $r$-radius graphs~\citep{li2008ease}
and $r$-cliques~\citep{kargar2011keyword}. 

\stitle{Keyword query suggestion}. 
Keyword query suggestion and its variants 
(\eg query refinement~\cite{mishra2009interactive} and reformulation~\citep{yao2012keyword}) 
have been studied to suggest new queries that better describe search intent 
for graph exploration. 
Most prior work adopts information retrieval techniques that make use of 
query logs and user feedback~\citep{carpineto2012survey,cao2008context}.
Keyword query suggestion for graphs has been studied in ~\citep{tran2009top} by suggesting structured queries computed from the keywords over RDF data. In order to summarize the results of \kws over structured data, tag clouds~\citep{koutrika2009data} discovers the most significant words retrieved as a part of the initial results. 
Provable quality guarantees of the answers are not addressed in these work. 

Query suggestion has been studied 
for XML data~\citep{zeng2014breaking}, 
with a focus on coping with missed matches. An approximate 
answer of original query $Q$ is computed by expanding 
its answer with content nodes of the same type, and 
new keywords are suggested to replace those 
without match in $Q$.
